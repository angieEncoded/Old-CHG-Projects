    <h1 id="administrators-handbook" class="mb-5">Administrator's Handbook</h1>

    <h2 id="jobs-module">Jobs Module</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>This module is required for the advanced jobs listing in the Event scheduler
    <ul>
    <li>Administrators of the system will add new jobs into the database as Square Enix adds them.
    <ul>
    <li>Ex. Square Enix adds Gunbreaker and Dancer in the new expansion, so the administrator adds those jobs to the database so we can now allow them in scheduling</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>The Event scheduler will read the database for the current existing possible jobs in Final Fantasy and then add them as selectable.</li>
    </ul></li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="duties-module">Duties Module</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>This is required for the event scheduler module
    <ul>
    <li>Crystal Haven leadership will decide which duties are popular at any given time and will add them to the system
    <ul>
    <li>Leadership can also add some 'generic' duties to classify things like Doggo farms, etc. under</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Event leaders will select the Duty and then Schedule their event for that duty.
    <ul>
    <li>The reason I designed it this way was to lower the number of 'free text' sections that would add confusion.</li>
    </ul></li>
    </ul></li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="events-module">Events module</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>This is dependant on the Duties and Jobs modules
    <ul>
    <li>The Event leader will select the duty to schedule an event against</li>
    <li>The Leader will fill in the relevant details and select either the default set of roles for that duty, or the more granular control over specific jobs</li>
    <li>Once the event is scheduled, the bot will do 'things' that we still have to discuss</li>
    </ul></li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="modules-that-are-not-important-at-this-time">Modules that are not important at this time</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Jobs Module
    <ul>
    <li>This is something we'll use once an xpac at most. I don't envision this seeing much traffic and worst case is I add to the database manually. In fact, for now I am just disabling all of the unneeded ones so we aren't overwhelmed.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Merlwyb's stuff
    <ul>
    <li>Again, this is something we'll use so seldom that I might as well not even have built her a module. Probably wasted more time than was necessary. But I love her!</li>
    </ul></li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="what-we-need-to-work-on-at-the-moment">What we need to work on at the moment</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>The general 'look and feel' of the site and exactly how to present the landing page.
    <ul>
    <li>What do we want to see there?</li>
    <li>Do we want some kind of 'Crystal Haven News' thing?</li>
    <li>Streamer details - I didn't think about it until just now but probably need a module to add the Streamer details as people come and go
    <ul>
    <li>I'll wait and see how Lumber and Leo want to handle that before going ham on another module. If we have 5 streamers total and only change details once a year... It's not worth it.</li>
    </ul></li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>The Duties module
    <ul>
    <li>Adding and adjusting duties needs to work, and if we want to store any additional information.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>The Events module
    <ul>
    <li>Of course, the bread and butter here is Event Scheduling.</li>
    <li>Making sure it works</li>
    <li>Making sure that Event Leaders think that the module stores enough relevant data about their events to communicate what they need to players</li>
    <li>And then we need to start working on Merlwyb's integration and how everyone expects sign ups to work.</li>
    </ul></li>
    </ul>
